I just wanted to see how many of the publicly listed companies took out a PPP loan. This is just a 
basic match of PPP loan data with that of the [Wilshire 5000 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilshire_5000).

You'll find the matched data under [data/matched.csv](data/matched.csv). Do what you may with it.
